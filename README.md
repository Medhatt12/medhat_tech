[MEDHAT.TECH] (https://medhat.tech/)

This is a Flutter cross platform app I developed for DMS course.

Personal portfolio developed with flutter to show case my previous courses and to allow companies to contact me through the website, for easier communication as a freelancer.

The portfolio has several sections:

- # ABOUT SECTION:
In this section I am introducing myself and a brief description about what I do.

- # SKILLS SECTION:
In this section, I added more information about the technologies I use and in detail what I can do. 

- # RECENT WORK SECTION:
In this section, I added the most recent projects I worked on.

- # FEEDBACK SECTION:
In this section, I added feedbacks from previous customers I worked with on previous projects.

- # CONTACT ME SECTION:
In this section, I added a contact form for customers or companies to contact me. An e-mail is sent directly to me when a contact form is sent.
